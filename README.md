# Used Inventory Web App
## Why It's Needed
In the tire industry, particularly at Discount Tire, used tires are a popular choice for customers on a budget. However, managing the inventory of these used tires can be a challenge. The inventory is often misorganized, making it difficult to find specific tires.

This web app aims to solve these problems by providing a system that can store and manage the inventory of used tires. It keeps track of key details for each tire, such as size, age, brand, and whether itâ€™s been checked for leaks.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The application includes a basic authentication system. Users must enter a valid username and password to access the inventory.

- **Add Tires**: Users can add new tires to the inventory. Each tire is defined by its measurement type, section width, aspect ratio, rim size, and load rating.

- **Remove Tires**: Users can remove tires from the inventory.

- **Search Tires**: Users can search the inventory for tires of a specific size.

- **View Inventory**: Users can view all tires in the inventory.

## Setup and Installation

2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your `.env` file with your `APP_USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `SECRET_KEY`.
4. Run the application with `python app.py`.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more secure authentication system.
- Improve the user interface with CSS.
