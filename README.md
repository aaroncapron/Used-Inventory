# Used Inventory Web App
## Why It's Needed
In the tire industry, used tires are a popular choice for customers on a budget. However, managing the inventory of these used tires can be a challenge. The inventory is often misorganized, making it difficult to find specific tires.

This web app aims to solve these problems by providing a system that can store and manage the inventory of used tires. It keeps track of key details for each tire, such as size, age, brand, and whether itâ€™s been checked for leaks.

## Features

- **Add Tires**: Users can add new tires to the inventory. Each tire is defined by its measurement type, section width, aspect ratio, rim size, and load rating. After adding the tire, the user is prompted to add another tire if needed. When the user is done adding tires, an SKU is set for each tires, and this SKU can be put on a label for the physical tire.

- **Remove Tires**: Users can remove tires from the inventory. Includes filters and sorting functions.

- **View Inventory**: Users can view all tires in the inventory. Includes filters and sorting functions.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more secure authentication system.

- Add an 4-digit SKU to each added tire so you can easily ID tires irl
- Add a date-added trait to each tire and an age calculator next to it
- TODO: limit tables in /remove and /show_inventory to their respective items per page count
